# Stoke: A 2D Catch Game

## Compilation Instructions

To build the game, download SFML 2.4.2 for your OS from the [official SFML website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php). Place the SFML/ folder with all the .hpp files into include/. Compile the program by entering "make" into the terminal.

Compilation on a Windows machine might require the use of the MinGW software. If you are using MinGW, copy the .dll files from  SFML-2.4.2/bin to C:\MinGW\bin. You must also edit the makefile to include the path to where you installed SFML.
